# Password System Using Binary-to-Decimal Converter  

## 1. Introduction  
The Password System project implements a secure access mechanism based on a binary-to-decimal converter. This system utilizes pushbuttons for binary input, displays the corresponding decimal value on a 7-segment display, and verifies the input against a predefined password. The project combines user input, real-time display, and verification logic to create a secure and interactive authentication system.  

### Goals of the Project  
The primary goals of this project include:  

- **Binary-to-Decimal Conversion:** Allow users to input binary values through pushbuttons, converting them into a decimal number displayed on a 7-segment display.  
- **Password Authentication:** Compare the decimal input with a predefined password for access control.  
- **Interactive Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback on the 7-segment display and additional indicators (e.g., LEDs or buzzer) for correct or incorrect password attempts.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Ensure simplicity and ease of use through intuitive input and display mechanisms.  
- **Scalability:** Design the system to support flexible password lengths and multiple attempts.  

### Problem Addressed  
Traditional password systems often rely on keyboards or touchscreens, which may not be suitable for compact or minimalistic designs. This project addresses these challenges by:  

- Replacing conventional input devices with pushbuttons for binary input.  
- Utilizing a 7-segment display for compact and efficient visual feedback.  
- Ensuring security through predefined passwords and immediate feedback for authentication attempts.  
- Simplifying the design for applications in embedded systems with limited resources.
